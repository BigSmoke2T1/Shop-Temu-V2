    - Enables casino heist content to be completed alone, to some degree
    - You can play now play Aggressive approach alone, enter through main gate, rest as usual
    - Silent & Sneaky will misbehave unless you get spotted by the guard intentionally on the first floor, which just turns into aggressive
